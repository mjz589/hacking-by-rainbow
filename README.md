# hacking-by-rainbow
*******************************************
You have a csv file that is divided into two parts. One part of that name and the other part is a hash of the password.

Hash is a one-way function that outputs y based on input x. But there is no mathematical formula to get from y to x. Its use is that you hash something and arrive at y.

If someone hacks function x, they won't get your real password. We have different hash function. Each hash function works in a specific way. (As a note: all passwords are 4 digits and the digits can be numbers 0 to 9. We also know that the sha256 algorithm was used for hashing.) This code separates the file information and its name and password. specifies

This method is called "rainbow hacking".

by the way, this project has been designed by "jadi mirmirani" and [maktabkhooneh.org] and i just coded it like a practice.
